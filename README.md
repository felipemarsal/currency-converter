# currency-converter
A VERY simple currency converter that will check a website (using JSON) to accurately update exchange rates. 

The cache in this scenario would represent the money that the machine currently holds (you can change this to include as many currencies as you want). After asking you for your initial currency, this program will continue asking you for the currency you would like to exchange to and the amount.
